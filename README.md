# Water-level-Detector-and-Automatic-Irrigation-Tools
This project is made with sensors, motors and Arduino to make an automated system for Irrigation and auto water tank filling

## Brief Description:
This project is built to automate the watering system. We know a lot of water is wasted during tank filling and irrigation due to unconsciousness. To prevent this waste we have developed a system with sensors which senses the water levels and thus turn them on and off automatically.

  To automate the tank filling system we have used Sonar Sensor. It measures the height of the water and if the water is below a certain level it turns on the motor.       Similarly, if the water level crosses a certain level, it turns off the motor.
  
   For automating the irrigation, we have used a Soil moisture sensor. It senses the moisture of the land and thus turns on and off the motor.
